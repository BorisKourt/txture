# txture: a web log engine for people who like flat files, convenience, and Lisp

**That fresh-ink scent don't come off a relational database.**

I like flat files better than databases for my writing. I also like
``meta`` tags and other search-engine luring information to be derived and
embedded into HTML based on the blog entries I write.

**txture** is based on these priorities. **txture** is readable and easily modified,
but it (should) work fine out of the box.
