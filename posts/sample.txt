Welcome to txture
-----------------

Check out the builtin Markdown rendering. Ask yourself the following
questions:

  1. What could be better about `txture`?
  2. Do you know who wrote `txture`?
  3. Do you know this joker's email address?
  5. Will you contact him with suggestions for `txture`?

Perfect. Try visting your [localhost]. It's probably where this website is being
hosted. 

A few things to do:
  
  - Learn the [Markdown syntax][Markdown]. It's pretty simple.
  - Take a look at `src/txture/config.clj`. It has all kinds of sweet options.
  - Figure out how to install plugins. It'll take all of three seconds.
